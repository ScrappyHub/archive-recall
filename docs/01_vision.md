Archive Recall makes personal archives and device restores reliable, verifiable, and reversible.

It is not "backup software" in the common sense.
It is a canonical library system that:
- never forgets what happened (append-only journal),
- proves what you have (hash identity + verification),
- and restores deterministically (staged, replayable pipelines).

Archive Recall is built for normal users, archivists, and operators who want:
- a one-click library index,
- a maintenance dashboard for integrity,
- and lawful import mirrors from major platforms as metadata + references.
